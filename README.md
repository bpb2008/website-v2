# üçí Welcome to CherryOnTech's v2 Website

We are a tech squad! We support each other as we learn and grow in our tech careers. We got the idea from [Mo Hampton](https://twitter.com/MoxieHampton)'s [JuneteenthConf](https://www.juneteenthconf.com/) talk, "[Breaking into Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N5fI5j-IIs)." Learn more about us in an upcoming blog post!

## üíª Tech Stack

- This website is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/), a static site generator that allows different frameworks to be used. We are using [React](https://react.dev/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) specifically in this Astro project.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Node.js is required (version 18.17.1, 20.3.0, or 22.0.0 or higher). It is recommended that you use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
2. Package Manager like `pnpm` or `npm` to manage the dependencies. [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) is recommended.
3. Astro CLI runs the development server and other development tasks. See the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/).
4. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/cherryontech/website-v2.git`
5. Go to the source folder: `cd website-v2`
6. Install dependencies: `pnpm install` or `npm install`
7. Run the website locally: `pnpm run dev` or `npm run dev`
8. Visit localhost at http://localhost:4321/

## üöÄ Project Structure

Below are some original notes from the Astro readme.

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ favicon.svg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layouts/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Layout.astro
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.astro
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
```

To learn more about the folder structure of an Astro project, refer to [our guide on project structure](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/).

## üó£Ô∏è Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |

| `pnpm dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `pnpm build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `pnpm preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `pnpm astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |

Okay, here's the expanded comparison table including Axios, `fetch`, Superagent, Request, Ky, Unirest, Redaxios, and Zenrows. Note that "Request" is generally considered deprecated, and Unirest is also not as actively maintained as some other options. Zenrows is quite different as it is a web scraping API service.

Key Considerations:

- **Request (Deprecated):** While included for completeness, be aware that the `request` library is deprecated and not recommended for new projects.
- **ZenRows (Web Scraping API):** This is fundamentally different from the other libraries. It's a paid web scraping API service, meaning you send requests to ZenRows' servers, and they handle the complexities of scraping websites (handling proxies, bypassing anti-bot measures, etc.) and return structured data to you. It's not a direct HTTP client library like the others.
- **Unirest:** Unirest offers libraries in multiple languages (Java, PHP, Python, etc.). The "Environment" and "Syntax" will vary depending on the specific language you are using.
- **Redaxios:** Redaxios is designed to be a very small Axios alternative.
